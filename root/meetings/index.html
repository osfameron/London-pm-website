			<li><strong>Ad-hoc Meetings</strong> typically when out-of-town visting Perl Mongers are in in town</li>

	</p>

	<p>Forthcoming meetings are announced on the <a href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm-announce">announce mailing list</a></p>

	<h2>Social Meetings</h2>

	<p>Social meetings happen every month on the day after the first Wednesday
		of the month (i.e. the first Thursday of the month that doesn't land
		on the very first day of the month.)</p>

	<p>Social meet are a chance for the various members of the group to meet
	up face to face and chat with each other about things - both Perl and
	(mostly) non-Perl - and newcomers are more than welcome. The monthly
	meets tend to be bigger than the other ad hoc meetings that take place
	at other times, and we make sure that they're in easy to get to
	locations and the pub serves food (meaning that people can eat in the
	bar if they want to). They normally start around 6.30pm (or whenever
	people get there after work) and a group tends to be left come closing
	time.</p>

	<p>If you're a newcomer or other first timer (even if you've been lurking
	on the mailing list or on IRC) then please seek our Glorious Leader Tom
	out - we have a tradition that the leader of this motley crew buys the
	new people a drink and introduces them to people.</p>

	<h2>Technical Meetings</h2>

	<p>Technical meetings happen every two months.  They take place in the evening, typically starting around 6:30pm - 7pm and lasting little over a couple of hours.</p>
	<p>The technical meetings are a chance to find out what has been going on in
	the Perl community, what techniques people are using and how Perl integrates
	with other software.  They consist of numerous technical presentations given
	by members of the group or by guest speakers on Perl or topics that might interest
	Perl programmers.  In some respects they can be thought of as a very
	small conference.</p>

	<p>Techmeets usually occur in larger office spaces graciously donated for the evening by the employers of Perl friendly companies.  As such we often have to ask attendees to sign up via a free web form in advanced to comply with the security policies of the venues.</p>

	<p>First time speakers are highly encouraged at techmeets (even if all you
		want to give is a five minute 'lightning' talk.)  A call for
		participation is posted to the main list some time prior to the tech
		meet itself.</p>

	<h2>Ad-Hoc Meetings</h2>

	<p>Ad-Hoc meetings are normally organised when a Perl Monger from out of
		town is in London on a day other than the social meetings.  They also
		occur around other events which many London.pm members may frequent (i.e.
		people may meet up at Linux conferences or even to go see the latest
		geek movie..)</p>

	<p>If you are visiting London and cannot join us for a social meeting, consider posting to the main list so a ad-hoc meeting can be arranged.</p>

	<p>One regular ad-hoc meeting (if you'll excuse the tautology) is the
		<a href="/about/faq.html#heretics">Heretics</a> pub meet which occurs
		on any Thursday 1st.</p>

	<h2>Open for all</h2>

	<p>No matter which meeting you choose, there's no requirement that you are
		proficient with Perl in order to turn up (in fact, several of our
		regular attendees haven't been technical at all, they've just enjoyed
		our company.)  We're a welcoming lot (we even have a friendly
		<a href="/conduct/">code of conduct</a> for all our meetings.)  In short:
		we look forward to seeing you.</p>
