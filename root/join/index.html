	<h2>So.. you really want to do it!</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		Well if you've got this far then you will probably want to go the whole way and join us.
		As mentioned in other locations on this site there are three (main) ways that one can join
		(all of which are free, or nominal cost - e.g. your phone bill to get internet connection!).
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Join the Mailing list</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		You can join the mailing list by visiting:<br />
		<a href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm">http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/london.pm</a>
		</p><p>
		If you missed something you can look at the archives at<br />
		<a href="/pipermail/london.pm/">http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm</a>
		</p>
		<p>The main list can be very busy, so you have the option of
joining the 
		announcement-only mailing list, which is moderated and very low
volume, at <br /> 
		<a href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm-announce">http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/london.pm-announce</a></p>
		<p>There are also historical archives of the list, from before
June 2001 at <br />

	</div>

	<h2>Join the IRC channel</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		irc.perl.org:6667 #London.pm - you'll need an irc
client, a piece of
		string and one of those washing up liquid bottles.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Come to a pissup - oops, umm, meeting...</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		We have two sorts of meetings, the social and the technical.
		</p>

		<p>
		Social are just that, lots of people getting together to discuss various
		things, some even perl related. We start about 6pm once a month on a
		Thursday (check the meetings diary for actual times and dates) and drink
		until the pub shuts and then go for a meal, or some combination of that.
		</p>

		<p>
		The Technical meetings are organised at a 'proper' venue (usually
		someone with a big meeting room at their company) and people
		are invited to give talks on whatever they are working on. These
		technical meetings have attracted people from Scotland, Wales
		and the odd (as in one or two, not as in wierd odd) Australian and
		American.
		</p>
		<p><a href="/meetings/">Check out the meetings page</a> to find out
about the next one and if there's an emergency or technical meeting in
the meantime.</p>
