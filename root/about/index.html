<h2>What is London.pm?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    London Perl Mongers is a group of people who use <a
    href="glossary.html#perl">Perl</a> in their work or personal
    programming projects and like to meet and talk about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    London.pm have technical and social meetings, have a mailing
    list, an IRC channel, and fit in to the larger <a
    href="glossary.html#perlmongers">Perl Mongers</a> organisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Curiously, London.pm members aren't confined to London or
    even the UK, but live all around the world.
  </p>
</div>


      
<h2>When do you meet?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    London.pm social meetings are held on the day after the first
    Wednesday of the month. This usually means the first Thursday of
    the month.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technical meetings are usually held on the third Thursday of
    every other month, although this sometimes moves to take into
    account the Perl conferences around the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additional "heretics" social meetings are held when the
    first day of a month is a Thursday.
  </p> 
</div>

<h2>How come meeting dates are so complex?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    Thereby hangs a <a href="faq.html#heretics">tale</a>.
  </p>
      
  <p>
    However, don't worry too much about the rules for when meetings
    are. Reminders are posted regularly to the mailing list, and
    there's a <a href="/meetings/">page on this site</a> which is
    kept up to date with forthcoming meetings.
  </p>
</div>
  
<h2>Where is the mailing list, and what's it for?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    You can <a href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm">subscribe to the
    london.pm mailing list</a> (also referred to occasionally as
    'london-list' or 'london.pm@london.pm.org') or read the <a
    href="/pipermail/london.pm">archives online</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mailing list is for general discussion of Perl in London,
    but there is no rigourously enforced topic. There are quite a
    lot of things that come up as <a
    href="faq.html#runningjokes">references and in jokes</a> and
    there are some things you should <a href="faq.html#spoilers">be
    careful about doing</a> on list as you can annoy people.
  </p>

</div>
  
<h2>I don't want that much mail. Is there an alternative?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    In addition to the general list, there's also an <a
    href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm-announce">announcement-only
    list</a>. This only receives about four or five mails a month,
    so might be more to your taste.
  </p>
</div>
  
<h2>You mentioned an IRC channel.</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    Several members of the group use the IRC channel #london.pm on
    the perl.org network. Connect to irc.perl.org, and /join
    #london.pm
  </p>

  <p>
    We have a fairly wide variety of <a
    href="/mailman/listinfo/bots">bots</a> on channel; there's a
    short <a href="irc.html">guide to the channel</a> so you know
    who's who.
  </p>
</div>


  <h2>What have London.pm achieved?</h2><div class="item">
    <p>
      London.pm have <a href="camel.html">sponsored a camel</a> at
      London Zoo for two years, organised the first <a
      href="http://yapc.org/Europe/2000/">YAPC::Europe</a> conference
      and raised a chunk of the initial funding for sponsoring <a
      href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/">Damian Conway</a> via
      YAS. London.pm members have spoken at all of the major Perl
      conferences, including TPC, YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe and the
      German Perl Workshop, and several of our members have authored
      <a href="/reviews/">books.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      We also have a server, penderel, which hosts this web site and
      out mailing lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      London.pm members have authored scores of CPAN modules, and
      contributed to the <a
      href="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net/">NMS</a> and <a
      href="http://www.tt2.org/">Template Toolkit</a> projects,
      amongst others.
    </p>
