<h2>Short Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
The full code of conduct can be summarised succinctly:
</p>

<p><blockquote>Don't be creepy.  You know the guy.  Don't be that guy.</blockquote></p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Full Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>1.Purpose</h3>

<p>
London.pm believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we
are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
preferred operating system, programming language, programming ability or text editor.</p>
</p>

<p>
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well
as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
</p>

<p>
We invite all posters to the mailing list, members of the irc channels, event
attendees, London.pm t-shirt wearers and other participants in the London.pm
community to help us realise a safe and positive experience for everyone.
</p>

<h3>2. Expected Behavior</h3>

<p>
Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
</p>

<p>
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior, speech, and
electronic communication. Be aware that what may be mild banter to you might be
perceived as demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior to other members or
potential members of the wider London.pm community.
</p>

<p>
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert the
London.pm leaders (part or present,) or event organisers if you notice a
dangerous situation or someone in distress.
</p>

<p>
Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to improve the
London.pm community.
</p>

<h3>3. Unacceptable Behavior</h3>

<p>
Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct on the mailing lists, irc
channels and while attending London.pm events and related events. Be aware
London.pm venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful
to all patrons of these locations. Be aware that electronic communications are
effectively archived forever and are accessible to the public and therefore
become the "public face" of London.pm.
</p>

<p>
Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or
sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate
intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<h3>4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>

<p>
Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated by anyone associated with the
London.pm community.
</p>

<p>
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the London.pm leaders (past
and present,) event organisers, or any person delegated responsibility by the
aforementioned may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including
permanent expulsion from the event, mailing list or irc channel.
</p>

<h3>5. What to do if you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior</h3>

<p>
If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being
subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a
London.pm leader (past or present,) event organiser, or any person delegated to
handle this task by the aforementioned as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
These people will be available to help participants contact law enforcement, and
in the case of in-person events contact venue security, to provide escorts, or
to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for
the duration of the event.
</p>

<p>
Members of the London.pm community are encouraged to bring these matters to the
attention of the London.pm leaders, event organisers, and delegated
representatives rather then dealing with issues solely themselves so matters can
be dealt with properly in a manner that does not expose those members to
accusations of personal vendettas. Issues of harassment are important, and as
such we are keen that issues are seen to be dealt with at a community wide
level.
</p>

<h3>6. Scope</h3>

<p>
We expect all people participating in the London.pm community, be it in person
or through electronic communication, to abide by this code of conduct whenever
they participate in the London.pm community.

<h2>About the Code Of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Does London.pm have a problem with harassment</h3>

<p>No!</p>

<p>
London.pm and the Perl community is very progressive and a non-offensive place
to be. The Perl community and the Perl programming language has and continues to
have significant contributions from statistically more diverse range of
individuals than the norm in the community industry. We, without hesitation,
recommend London.pm to anyone regardless of their gender, race or sexual
orientation because we believe that given a chance you'll find that London.pm is
a welcoming place for everyone.
</p>

<h3>Doesn't publishing a code of conduct indicate that there's a problem? That London.pm is the kind of place where such a conduct occurs?</h3>

<p>
IT communities have a developed a bad reputation for being sexist and
intolerant. This sadly means that no matter what London.pm is actually like,
unless we provide a clear declaration that is visible outside our community
people outside our community will fear that we are like any other IT
community.
</p>

<p>
To be blunt: In our opinion if you're not seen actively as part of the solution
then people will assume (rightly or wrongly) that you're complicit with the
problem. While self-policing without a code of conduct may in fact work well, it
cannot be observed external to the community. A published code of conduct can.
</p>

<h3>If this is a set of <em>rules</em> won't it simply encourage people to game the rules?</h3>

<p>
Firstly, let us not get confused between a set of rules (which detail exactly
what you can and can't do) and a code of contact (which details what is expected
from you.) While some people may quibble the semantic differences between the
two I'll hope you'll agree that the latter is a lot closer to simply codifying
the social expectations that we had in place prior to this code of conduct being
published.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, London.pm is not suggesting dismantling or replacing anything that we
have in place prior to the publication of this code of conduct.  The same social
rules still apply.  There's nothing in this documents that that seeks to limit
or restrict the absolute authority of the London.pm leader to deal with anyone
who, in their opinion, who is acting detrimentally to rest of the group in any
way he or she feels fit. It's just writing down <em>some</em> of what already
happened.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, it's been suggested that the long version invites people to argue that
<em>their</em> particular behaviour isn't boorish. Those people are going to
argue anyway, be it the short version, long version, or just the current social
conventions, because that's the kind of people they are.
</p>

<h3>Do people really need to be told this?</h3>

<p>
The vast majority of people don't. However, the two groups of people that do are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
People who are worried that they might be victims of harassment. They need to be
reassured - especially when they've only just joined the community and haven't
had time to completely integrate and have full knowledge of it - that harassment
won't be tolerated and they need to know the procedure to follow if they do have
any problem.
</li>

<li>
People who have missed the social context (especially new people to the
community.) We all know that we modify our behaviour depending on the social
context we're in (we might act differently in the office than we do in the pub.)
New members of the community can often mistake one social context for another
and this can cause accidental offence to other members of the community. The
code of conduct can help provide the social context to avoid this mistake
(especially the one line version, "Don't be creepy. You know the guy, don't be
that guy.")
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Isn't the policy too long? Is anyone going to read this?</h3>

<p>Probably not the majority of people, no (that's why we included the one line
summary after all.) But people do care we have one, and some people do
want to have explicitly spelled out what kind of thing is a problem and what
they can do if there is a problem.</p>
